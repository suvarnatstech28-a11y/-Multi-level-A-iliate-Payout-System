This project implements a 5-level multi-level affiliate (MLM) payout system in PHP/Laravel.
Whenever a user makes a sale, the system automatically distributes commissions to their upline, up to 5 levels above.

If the sale is made by a user at level 6 or below, the payout still flows upward to the first 5 parents.

This system is commonly used in e-commerce, referral networks, and affiliate marketing platforms.
